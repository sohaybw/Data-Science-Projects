              " '\"\\n\\nIs it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don\\'t answer the questions beyond that\\nWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \\n\\nFirst, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \\n\\nSecond, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don\\'t understand it, you can\\'t do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn\\'t have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it\\'s so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don\\'t understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \\n\\nFinally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that\\'s all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that\\'s what killed him. You don\\'t have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you\\'ve never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn\\'t science.  \"',\n",

              " 'Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.\\n\\nThe major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.',\n",

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.\\n\\nThe Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\\n\\n                           History\\nThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\\n\\n                       Proper History\\nAs early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\",\n",

If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you\\'re claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.\\n\\nThe two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don\\'t suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same \"\"tag team\"\" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.\\n\\nIt would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under \"\"UK mediation\"\" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

              " '\"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == \\nInvitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don\\'t pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

Don\\'t answer the questions beyond that\\nWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \\n\\nFirst, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \\n\\nSecond, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don\\'t understand it, you can\\'t do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn\\'t have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it\\'s so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don\\'t understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \\n\\nFinally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that\\'s all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that\\'s what killed him. You don\\'t have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you\\'ve never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn\\'t science.  \"',\n",

              " 'Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.\\n\\nThe major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.',\n",

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.\\n\\nThe Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\\n\\n                           History\\nThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\\n\\n                       Proper History\\nAs early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\",\n",

              " '\"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == \\nInvitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don\\'t pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

paragraph edit , I don t understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that I m sure that the data are necessarily wrong Rather I m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject , I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly enhanced and I also believe those changes are no improvement , In support of my view that this edit should be reverted I would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists , A1 , Benjamin Cardozo, A2 , Learned Hand, B1 , John Marshall Harlan, B2 , John Marshall Harlan II, The question becomes Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph , I think not , Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging , I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point , Less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale , At a minimum I m questioning this edit , It deserves to be reconsidered ,  Radial symmetry , Several now extinct lineages included in the Echinodermata were bilateral such as Homostelea or even asymmetrical such as Cothurnocystis Stylophora ,  There s no need to apologize , A Wikipedia article is made for reconciling knowledge about a subject from different sources and you ve done history studies and not archaeology studies I guess , I could scan the page e mail it to you and then you could ask someone to translate the page Yes because the mother of the child in the case against Michael Jackson was studied in here motives and reasonings and judged upon her character just as harshly as Wacko Jacko himself , Don t tell me to ignore it and incriminate myself , I am going to continue refuting the bullshit that Jayjg keeps throwing at me , 18 01 16 Jun 2005 UTC , Ok But it will take a bit of work but I can t quite picture it , Do you have an example I can base it on , the Duck A barnstar for you ,  , The Real Life Barnstar lets us be the stars,  How could I post before the block expires , The funny thing is you think I m being uncivil Not sure about a heading of Fight for Freedom what will it contain Praise , looked at this article about 6 months ago much improved ,  I was able to post the above list so quickly because I already had it in a text file in my hard drive I ve been meaning to get around to updating the sound list for some time now , As far as generating interest I ve spent four years trying to drum up more interest in freely licensed full length classical music , Unfortunately my attempts failed I m still effectively the only one who does it , The classical music wikiproject was not interested Wikipedia_talk WikiProject_Classical_music Archive_5 Need_help 21Wikipedia_talk WikiProject_Music Archive_3 I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talk WikiProject_Music Archive_2 Raulbot 2C_and_the_music_list So I really had given up trying to interest others , The sound list was featured on digg a while back http digg com music Wikipedia_has_free_classical_music_downloads , It got 1600 diggs which is IMO very impressive , Well not before the process but before how we do things with subpages His RfA is listed on NoSeptember s page and you can find it if you look , September 2004 I think , I have my differences with El_C to be sure but was surprised to see a block so I left a note ,  t c , Not at all you are making a straw man argument here , I never claimed O Donohue had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position which is exactly what the quote says and also something O Donohue agrees with , Again I was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation , Since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd , The disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do , At the end of the day it is a value judgment as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement , If we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis ,  ,  Mainland Asia includes the lower basin of China s Yangtze River as well as Korea , But being specific is fine too , I just found a citation for a more comprehensive DNA study by Hammer below rather than our generarizations and speculation so far , Citation for Yayoi culture was brought to Japan by migrants from Korea who in turn trace their roots to southeast Asia south China , 2005 DNA study by Hammer, Describes the Yayoi migration from Korea based on the O SRY 465 genes and other genes with close lineage haplogroups O M122 and O M95 , Reiterates that the entire O haplogroup has been proposed to have a Southeast Asian origin Their definition of Southeast Asia includes southern China , Then hypothesizes that the dispersals of Neolithic farmers from Southeast Asia also brought haplogroup O lineages to Korea and eventually to Japan , In the concluding paragraph it states we propose that the Yayoi Y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern Asia perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region , Hammer s DNA study is based on a global sample consisted of 2 500 males from 39 Asian populations including six populations sampled from across the Japanese archipelago ,  pretty much everyone from warren county surrounding regions was born at glens falls hospital , myself included , however i m not sure this qualifies anyone as being a glens falls native , rachel ray is i believe actually from the town of lake luzerne ,  The preceding unsigned comment was added by 70 100 229 154 04 28 57 August 19 2007 UTC Hi Explicit can you block O Fenian for edit warring on the Giant s Causeway wp , He has made several edits which can only be described as terrorism Notability of Rurika Kasuga, A tag has been placed on Rurika Kasuga requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia , This has been done because the article seems to be about a person group of people band club company or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia , Under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time , Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable you may contest the tagging , To do this add on the top of the page below the existing db tag and leave a note on the article s talk page explaining your position , Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but don t hesitate to add

know I should bow down to the almighty administrators , But then again I m going to go play outside with your mom , 76 122 79 82 I don t believe the Lisak criticism present there conforms with the NPV rule , Lisak doesn t have a neutral point of view to begin with , If an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered the recantation is still perfectly valid , If you know you are telling the truth you will argue with machine or investigator , Also part of Kanin s research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations , In all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened , Arguing that Lisak is a respected PHD is baseless if Kanin is a respected PHD , I agree that my edit wasn t as neutral as possible though so apologize for that , Still something must be done here You had a point and it s now ammended with appropriate encyclopedic notability significance In other words you re too lazy to actually point anything out , Until you change that approach the tag goes , As for your claims of stalking that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation , I have assumed good faith and good intentions on your part and have never suggested or seen reason to suggest that you might have some ulterior motive in mass adding links to one specific company s web page , Nor for that matter have I ever made any suggestion that this is an administrative matter or even mentioned such a role ,  Clearly as a party to this disagreement I would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest I would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations ,  chatspy ,  Jmabel in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite Third Way rhetoric fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right wing force , As far as I m aware owning numerous books on the subject that is not the scholary consensus at all , The consensus developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin Hamish McDonald Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a Third Way as the references show , The only dissenters I m aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible , This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books , For example even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy Renzo De Felice doesn t try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status , This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini ,  ,  , BI you said you wanted to talk, At the bottom of the lead section you have written ,  Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts , In addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials , Regarding In addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials , That statement appears to come from Ref 3 on page 10 , The full quote is,  If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload , then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly, feasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible in, the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher, operational temperatures , It then goes on to say,  As we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL, tethers needed , The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is ,  We don t need magic materials like Buckminster Fuller carbon nanotubes to make, the space tether facility for a HASTOL system , Existing materials will do , So it would appear that you misread your reference , The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem , Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials , To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states,  The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is, technically feasible , We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will, allow hypersonic air breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning space, tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into, Earth orbit , For more than one HASTOL architecture concept we have developed a design, solution using existing or near term technologies , We expect that a number of the other, HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to, detailed design studies , The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically, reducing the cost of Earth to orbit space access , Regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts and ,  A 2000 Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that In general the non spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts , The full quote is ,  HyperSkyhook, In 1995 Zubrin proposed the Hypersonic Skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between, the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers , Since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu GET FUCKED UP , GET FUCKEEED UP , GOT A DRINK THAT YOU CANT

living in the middle east , This is wrong , We middle eastern Christians though not arabs have gone through Arabization and that needs to stop , We are not arabs , We have our own ethnicity and we shouldn t be forced to be called Christian arabs , If a Christian European is born in the middle east should he be called a Christian arab because of that reason alone , Please understand they are Syriac Christians i e of Assyrian ancestry and most of them speak Aramaic though a lot of them are forgetting it , As someone who speaks Aramaic you should respect this fact and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they re in the middle east , We are not closely related to the arabs from Saudiarabia , We have our own ethnicity please stop forcing upon us some alien

Irish wasn t invented on the establishment of the Irish Free State , Talk , Quote me all you want it depends on the context of the term when its being used as to whether its applicable or not , Note how i said citizenship and ethnicity i never mentioned nationality which is the real key meaning , The nationality meaning of the term is the predominantly used form on Wikipedia , In nationality terms it refers to the Republic of Ireland , But you already know that i m sure ,  talk ,  In nationality terms it refers to the Republic of Ireland no such country , so nationality terms it refers to Ireland ,  Preceding unsigned comment added by 109 76 191 188 , Oh wow Ireland as in Ireland the state whose official description is the Republic of Ireland , Whats the point in this inane

deletion template has been added to the article Minimization of textile effluent suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process , All contributions are appreciated but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia s criteria for inclusion and the deletion notice should explain why see also What Wikipedia is not and Wikipedia s deletion policy , You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the notice but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on its talk page , Also please consider improving the article to address the issues raised , Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria or it can be sent to Articles for Deletion where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached , If you agree with the deletion of the article and you are the only person who has made substantial edits to the page please add to the top of Minimization of textile effluent ,  , Is it scientific to attribute an event A to cause B where cause B was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent , Don t answer the questions beyond that, Well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged , There are several major fundamental problems here , First you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth , Natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees , That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth , ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here , This is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology , When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes , No evidence of paul and his ox remain , i mean really , Second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable , Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up , ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities , If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria , If you don t understand it you can t do statistics on it , ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn t have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well it s so improbable for this to happen that someone MUST have designed it , This is such a perversion of science , You can assign probabilities to something you don t understand , ID is just making up their numbers , Finally your example has A B where B was deliberate design , that s all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth B is unknown , Your A B example might qualify as forensic science if A were a dead body and B were a bullet in the heart , You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure that s what killed him , You don t have that with life on earth , You have ONE scenario A and you have no other cases to observe or test , So in that sense A B is not scientific if you ve never actually observed B ,  btw B is teh intelligent designer which has NEVER been observed , So in that sense no it isn t science ,  Screwjob , Hey i noticed your comments on the Montreal Screwjob discussion page , I decided since nobody except someone with no account objected to what you said , I would atleast

reference this , Also the style statistics are bad , When you say style statistics it sounds like a prescription not a description , An encyclopedia should follow the latter and if the former is used a citation should follow And you ll not find a valid one for this style in it s country of origin , What s up with this ,  If you are a religiously or politically motivated to push this or that issue

result in what is typically called a fossil , One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc , And multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc , Talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned , The major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in , Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue , The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains , Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working , Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains , Yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with Also I think Vegetable Basket needs it s own Wikipedia page Bigfoot Reference , The magazine is better known as just the Engineering and Mining Journal which you may have a difficult time finding depending on where you live , I ran across the article a few years ago while researching something else and made a copy , It is clearly derived from press accounts and treats the incident as a joke , My whole point in citing it was to show that the incident whatever it was was not entirely created 40 years after the fact , If you leave me your email I will scan the page and email you a PDF Also see this if you cant trust Murkoth Ramunni, http books

Famous Article witze happiness wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families regardless of race age character or knowledge , The outside world knows little about these elusive characters and the honour of the Witzeman , For those who have ever been a Witzeman it has been said to have been a great honour although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed , A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams , Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman , The Present Witzeman is an 11 year old boy namely Benjamin Woods who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this awesome radiance in his top right bumcheek , He has not told a great number of people his testimony but has promised to do so in years to come , History, The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time , The term Witzeman is a compound word of the adjective Witze and man witze being an 11th century term for a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence , Unfortuneatly Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind for unspeakable reasons , Proper History, As early as the 14th century Witzemen were considered outcasts and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks , This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team , This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced gaga at a Government meeting that year , The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history , However good times were to come for the Witzeman , Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s building up to a great moment in the history the Great Rebellion of 1988 , This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons wearing clown masks but otherwise completely naked , This was thought to be an act of circambulation , However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour were mentally spiritually and emotionallly scarred for life , This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability suffering from trauma , It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman , In 1990 a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased , Although this was a formal agreement many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted , OK just finished my planned cleanup of the todo page , The entries that were removed were copied to the investigated entries page so we have a record that we looked at

Hypothesis paper on her tripod site for mp3 links The statement drawn from Watchtower literature honestly not clandescently not with hypocrisy is drawn from Watchtower literature via Ray Franz s arguments and literature and imposed into the Wikipedia article , It s too much of a coincidence that a more or less follower of Ray Franz is going to come up with a reference to Wa literature on his own exactly the same connection Ray Franz makes without having first seen the connection made in Ray Franz literature , Natural, Nature Sorry about that , I had checked but had only come up with Dulas Bay , Somehow I had missed the Dulas disambiguation page completely , Apologies again it s not even as if it was getting particularly late at night , The onset of swine flu perhaps TCM , I can find no evidence that acupressure is a TCM rather than derived from TCM , If no one objects I ll place a citation note in the article Well it still needs expansion in areas citations in others more images was going to get a pic of the Stanley Cup banner tonight at the Hitmen game but forgot my camera and a thorough review copy edit by someone with a better flair for words than I but work progresses , lute A redirect somewhere couldn t hurt though I still don t think any o the candidates are ideal , But then if he passes the notability threshold some day the basic material is still there to work with Meivazhi, I ve had a go at restarting the Meivazhi article in a style that s more standard for Wikipedia articles , Someone would probably have deleted it pretty quickly if it had stayed in the form you posted , I d be grateful if you could help at Talk Meivazhi about the accuracy , Unfortunately I had to remove your links , The conflict of interest guidelines advise against editors linking to

newspaper book accounts of Meivazhi , PS What is the salaimanimudi indlist com site , A personal site by a member Though this is certainly a small article but it is not so inconsequential as to warrant subsuming it within the Flame Trees article , It is a discography article and should stand alone , 22 May 2005 Yeah let s merge the content ,  Not sure if Devil s Canyon is the same type of

another go the 20th very last on the parliamentary election winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned ,  , By the way here s something very little people have figured out the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo secession , The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility and after the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed causing new elections because that was unconstitutional as an act of highest treason enough to be tried from maximum sentence which the Radicals demanded from then to his death to have a trial in Serbia and to be tried for treason among other reasons , This constitution releases the authorities from that weight and they won t have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo ,  15 New WikiProject Novels initiative, We have begun a new initiative at the WikiProject Novels an

details , Also I would like to remind you to keep an eye on the project talk page at Wikipedia talk WikiProject Novels , Thanks , Reply, Are you being facetious , if not you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres , If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk then I will only be too glad to provide , You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me in regards to which words you re claiming are offesive perhaps WP Assume good faith , The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines WP HARASS is just one , For example the removal of third party references from articles which don t suit their POV without entering an edit summary considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP BLANK , The violation of WP NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with despite being made aware of the policy despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term , The same tag team practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties not just against me , Again if you would like evidence just ask , It would seem however looking at the messages on your talkpage above especially the lovely intertude under UK mediation section that Jza messaged you somebody he seems very familiar with in violation of WP CANVAS , Specifically the section on Wikipedia CANVAS Campaigning may interest you , If you re going to be an admin may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message , Rather than accusing me a user who is being cyberstalked of personal attacks , Systematic bias is not acceptable you re here to make sure that our policies are upheld not to chip in for the sake of a friend , Thanks ,  P S It s not polite to talk to people behind their backs please remove your comments from Mrph s talk page ,

make it stop , May I also ask what was wrong with the honest statement I made on talk page and what you mean by hasty refactoring , I appreciate any assistance and welcome any questions , BTW when do

of the invisible hand , First Smith was not advocating a social policy that people should act in their own self interest but rather was describing an observed economic reality that people do act in

that self interest is necessarily bad , It is worth noting that upon his death Smith left much of his personal wealth to charity , Good , Let s all make sure we put forth the idea that Adam Smith was

is welcomed , Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well known ideological systems may raise here , I propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word , Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains , My initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period Some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists , This definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of Lithuania , We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat Renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us , Cultural aspirations of the later Nat Ren , may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania , But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically Lithuanian , I mean that such authors in as Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of Lithuanian culture when in European or World wide context , A parallel example may be taken from literature of India , Poet Tagore well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India , Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture , But in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones , This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N , Ren could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in Lithuanian context , They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture , Čiurlionis is the best example here , In other way the later Lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life see the table below , We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here , The problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen , So many researchers don t pay attention to this difference , Especially in the Soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed , E g , philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal , And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism , period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period the younger generation approx 1905 1930 painter and composer Čiurlionis painter Kazys Šimonis poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas Vydūnas dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė Čiurlionienė

, has the community not gotten smaller , was it not caused by the automobile , have I not sourced the statement as asked , is it not a fact , is it not information , does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was , is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present , is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not , if so it should be noted that I simply re added the information after it was removed , was not the removal frivilous and unwarranted , what is the problem , why insist on the absence of this statement , it is unjustifiable , it is negligible , I am re adding the information as it is A factual B sourced and C informative , I assume that since there is no reason to remove it again or in the first place that you and all other Wiki Nazis will relax , If you are concerned with useless edits please see the edit fom the

opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay , In this way their way of life will be received as being not only harmless but perfectly normal , As generations of people grow from childhood to

similar to a religion race or nationality , Lestrade Al Messier , This article was a non notable biography according to the criteria set out in WP BIO ,  aeropagitica '"
